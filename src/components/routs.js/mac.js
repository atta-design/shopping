                major differences between each model mean there isn't a one-size-fits-all 
                option. At the end of last year, Apple released a new MacBook Air and entry-level MacBook
                 Pro with a custom ARM-based M1 chip, the company's first in-house SoC (processor/graphics combo).
                  The processor brought massive performance and battery life improvements to Apple's least expensive laptops, pushing them ahead of
                 their pricier MacBook Pro comrades and even some top Windows 10 rivals. </p>
